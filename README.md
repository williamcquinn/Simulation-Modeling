# Simulation-Modeling
Ontario Gateway: Simulation modeling (1M Trials), to simulate incidental damages of $1-5M over the span of 5 years for losses of each aircraft.

Mary Litton, Chief Operating Officer of Ontario Gateway, re-read the
memo she had just dictated and sighed. She did not envy her Operations staff the task she had just assigned to them. Making sense
of all the available data and quotes to choose the best aircraft insurance policy for the Ontario Gateway fleet of aircraft would not
be an easy job. Furthermore, if the wrong policy was chosen, the
company would have to live with the consequences until the policy
expired in five years time. She hoped her staff would be able to make
good sense of all the data in her memo and would turn the data into
a sound (and defensible) insurance policy recommendation in time
for the Board of Directors’ meeting on December 11. At that time,
she would have to put forward the recommended insurance policy
to the rest of the Board, and be prepared to justify her choice with
supporting data and analysis.

**Background**

Ontario Gateway Corporation was the brainchild of Ontario Airlines
CEO, Robert McDermott. Mr. McDermott, a French-Canadian, had
built Ontario Airlines from a small cargo-carrying enterprise serving Canada, into a respectable, but marginal passenger carrier serving North American air transportation hubs. In Spring of 1995, he
approached the Chairman of Air Prix Corporation (a French passenger carrier serving selective parts of Europe) about a possible
merger while attending a European Union Aviation Convention in
Paris, France. After several months of consultation, a memorandum
of understanding was reached that led to the merger of both firms
and the creation of a new world class airline, Ontario Gateway.

**The Global Airline Industry**

The airline industry in North America had become extremely competitive since deregulation over
a decade ago. Furthermore, competition in the European airline industry had been heating up as
well, mostly as a result of market initiatives within the European Union. State-owned airlines were
being considered for privatization, while the market itself was being deregulated under “open skies”
initiatives that allowed all European Union (EU) based airlines to fly without restriction within the
EU. The EU retained restrictions on non-EU airline firms, as did the US and Canada. Thus, EU based
firms had a competitive advantage over non-EU firms within Europe, while North American firms
likewise essentially competed only among themselves.

**Ontario Airlines**

Ontario Airlines drew little notice within North America until it began upgrading its fleet of largely
older leased DC-8 and DC-9 aircraft in 1994. The first of 47 Boeing 757 aircraft was delivered in the
Fall of that year, and the firm held an option to buy 28 more aircraft at the same price and financing
terms over the next three years. This allowed Ontario Airlines to modernize virtually overnight,
giving the firm a homogenous fleet of the most advanced passenger aircraft in the world.

Mr. McDermott was determined to make his firm the most efficient airline in North America.
The firm aggressively priced its way into the major North American hubs, and created a highlytrained pool of pilots and service personnel dedicated only to the operation of the 757 fleet. Ontario
Airlines tended to routinely fill their flights, helping the firm to cover costs on even the most
aggressively priced routes.

**Air Prix**

Formed in 1992 to coincide with the opening of markets in the European Community, Air Prix was
a “Southwest Airlines style” upstart airline in France. Although its major competitor was stateowned Air France, it managed to eke out positive earnings on routes between Paris, Lille, Lyons,
and Marseilles by efficiently operating only in these profitable routes. Preparing for aggressive
operations throughout Europe in the coming years, Air Prix negotiated in 1993 with both Airbus
and Boeing to obtain preferable arrangements to acquire new aircraft. A deal was finally reached for
the EU to finance the purchase of 39 Airbus A340 aircraft. By Spring of 1995, Air Prix was flying its
fleet of A340s within France and parts of Europe, but was having difficulty competing with British
Airways and other firms. Even though Air Prix enjoyed generous financing subsidies, it had trouble
filling up the large A340s on a consistent basis.

**The Merger Strategy**

Air Prix and Ontario Airlines were very similar. Both firms were relatively small and had recently
purchased new aircraft, and both firms were serving their respective continental markets. A merger
would create a truly world class airline with the legal right to serve both the North American and
EU markets. Furthermore, it could then exercise the option to buy more of the Boeing 757s and use
them on the European routes, while shifting the A340s (which have more seating capacity and can
fly longer distances) into trans-Atlantic service. The objective was to exploit operational economies
of scope on a global basis.

**Managing Risk**

Partially because of the peculiarities of the financing terms for its fleets of aircraft, the newly
formed Ontario Gateway Corporation was highly leveraged, requiring much of its cash flow to
service its substantial debt obligations. The situation was further complicated by pre-existing loan
agreements that restricted the firm’s freedom to issue any further debt for a minimum of five years.
If for any reason the firm were to face a cash flow problem, creditors could easily bring the firm
into bankruptcy for failing to meet current debt obligations. Mr. McDermott felt that his firm faced
several major risks over and above the normal business risks in the air transportation industry.
These risks were exchange rate risk, political risk, and accident risk.

Exchange rate risk was analyzed in detail during the merger negotiations. Both firms intended
to avoid the exchange-rate-driven bankruptcy that brought Sir Freddie Laker’s Laker Airlines a
decade earlier. Even after thorough analysis, it was found that Ontario Gateway’s costs and revenues
were fairly balanced in ECU (European Currency Unit) and U.S. dollar terms. McDermott had directed
the Treasurer to implement a currency hedging strategy in the currency options markets, to ensure
that exchange rate risk was minimized.

Political risk essentially entailed the exposure to potential government interference in both
the North American and EU market operations. The firm’s lawyers believed that they had firm legal
grounds to ward off protectionst regulatory attacks in either markets. Nonetheless, Mr. McDermott
took every opportunity to promote his airline in France and Europe as a Franco-French Canadian
venture that supported Airbus and the concept of EU economic integration. Furthermore, he made
sure that press coverage in the United States regularly reminded the public of the firm’s clsoe
relationship with Boeing, and its furtherance of open skies under the NAFTA framework.

Accident risk was traditionally handled in both firms by insurance contracts that would separately cover legal liability for loss-of-life and the cost of damage to the aircraft. Damage cost
includes replacement cost due to catastrophic failure and the cost of incidental damage which occurs during normal use of the aircraft. The firm was covered for loss-of-life liability claims by a
standard policy that was competitively priced. Aircraft loss coverage (for damage cost) was another
matter. The Airbus A340s were covered under a policy issued to Air Prix by Lloyds of London. The
Boeing 757s were covered by an initial purchase insurance policy issued through the U.S. ExportImport Bank by the Reinsurance Corporation of Northern California (RCNC). Both the coverage of
the Boeing 757s through RCNC and the Lloyds of London policy on the A340s will expire on March
1, 1997.

Thus on December 1, 1996, Mr. McDermott directed his Chief Operating Officer, Mary Litton,
to obtain alternative insurance policy bids (see Enclosure 1) and make a recommendation regarding
aircraft loss insurance coverage after March 1, 1997. Although Mr. McDermott was reasonably
happy with the RCNC policy, he wanted to investigate the cost effectiveness of alternative insurance
plans before he decided what to do after March 1, 1997. His specific guidance was as follows:

“I want the entire fleet covered on a cost-effective basis — no more Lloyds of London
over-priced policies! But don’t forget — we have got to maintain cash flow at its current
level. This means we must be thoroughly covered for any loss of aircraft; if we lose a
plane, we will need the cash to replace it quickly — otherwise we will be driven straight
into bankruptcy court.”

Mary returned to her office to contemplate her boss’s guidance. She reached into the file
containing the recently obtained aircraft insurance proposals from the RCNC, the Canadian Trust
Company (CTC), and Hawthorne Insurance Corporation (HIC). Although the mechanics of the policies were very easy to understand, it was not easy to translate the numbers into a workable sense
of the risk coverage that each proposal offered. She was determined to create an accurate picture
of the costs and benefits of each of the policies in order to make an informed recommendation to
the CEO.
